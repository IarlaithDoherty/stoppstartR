\title{Implement START-A4 criterion.}
\usage{
start_a4(
  df,
  comorb_string = "Comorbidity_",
  drug_string = "Drug_",
  systolic_column = "Systolic",
  diastolic_column = "Diastolic"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame: Patient information.}

\item{comorb_string}{Character string: Common text contained in the name of
each comorbidity column which uniquely identifies them.}

\item{drug_string}{Character string: Common text contained in the name of
each drug column which uniquely identifies them.}

\item{systolic_column}{Character string: The name of the systolic column.}

\item{diastolic_column}{Character string: The name of the diastolic column.}
}
\value{
A character vector with one entry per patient / row in \code{df}. Each
entry takes one of the following three values:
\itemize{
\item "Not Relevant" if the conditions are not satisfied.
\item "Appropriate" if the conditions are satisfied but the correct drugs
have been prescribed.
\item The name of the criterion if the conditions are satisfied and the
correct drugs have not been prescribed. That is, if this START
criterion has been triggered.
}
}
\description{

}
\details{

\itemize{
\item None of the following drugs:

C07, C08, C09, C03A, C03EA.
\item Any of the following subconditions:
\itemize{
\item Systolic_BP > 160
\item Diastolic_BP > 90
\item Systolic_BP > 140 and any of the following comorbidities:

E10, E11, E12, E13, E14
