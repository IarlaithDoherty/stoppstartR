\usage{
stopp_b13a(
  df,
  systolic_column = "Systolic_BP",
  comorb_string = "Comorbidity_",
  drug_string = "Drug_"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame: Patient information.}

\item{systolic_column}{Character string: The name of the systolic column.}

\item{comorb_string}{Character string: Common text contained in the name of
each comorbidity column which uniquely identifies them.}

\item{drug_string}{Character string: Common text contained in the name of
