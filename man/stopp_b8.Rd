\usage{
stopp_b8(
  df,
  potassium_column = "Lab Values: K",
  sodium_column = "Lab Values: Na",
  calcium_column = "Lab Values: Corrected Ca",
  drug_string = "Drug_",
  comorb_string = "Comorbidity_"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame: Patient information.}

\item{potassium_column}{Character string: The name of the patient potassium
column.}

\item{sodium_column}{Character string: The name of the patient Na column.}

\item{calcium_column}{Character string: The name of the patient CCa column.}

\item{drug_string}{Character string: Common text contained in the name of
each drug column which uniquely identifies them.}

\item{comorb_string}{Character string: Common text contained in the name of
each comorbidity column which uniquely identifies them.}
}
\value{
A character vector with one entry per patient / row in \code{df}. Each
entry takes one of the following three values:
\itemize{
\item "Not Relevant" if the conditions are not satisfied.
\item "Appropriate" if the conditions are satisfied but the incorrect drugs
have not been prescribed.
\item The name of the criterion if the conditions are satisfied and the
incorrect drugs have been prescribed. That is, if this STOPP
criterion has been triggered.
}
}
\description{

STOPP-B8 requires all of the following conditions to be satisfied:
\itemize{
\item Any of the following drugs:

C03A, C03BA, C03EA01, C03EA02, C03EA13, C03EA07, C09XA52, C09XA54, C07B,
